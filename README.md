This is a command-line implementation of the game, Battleship, written in Ruby.

To get started, follow the instructions below. Once the game begins, you can follow the game's instructions to play a game!

## Quick Start

After cloning the repo, `cd` into `/cli_battleship` and run

```
$ ruby battleship.rb
```

## Install
To get started, let's ensure that you have Ruby installed by running

```
$ ruby -v
```

in your terminal, (without the `$`). This command should tell you which version of Ruby you have installed, if any. This application was built using `ruby 2.4`, but many older and newer versions should work as well! To find out more, and to install Ruby, please visit the official Ruby website [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Next, you'll need to download these files onto your computer. Probably the easiest way to accomplish that is by cloning this repo from Github. If you're unfamiliar with cloning, you can learn more [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Once you've done that, be sure to `cd` into the `/cli_battleship` directory, there you can enter

```
$ ruby battleship.rb
```

into the terminal to begin the game! You should see something like this:

```
Welcome to Battleship!
```

Follow the instructions to play the game! Enjoy!
